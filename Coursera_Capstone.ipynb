    "A restauranteer is seeking to open a new restaurant.  The restauranteer would like to open a new location in the Charlotte area but doesn't know what area to invest in.  He hopes to open in an area that currently lacks restaurant venues and is in an area easily accessible (near public transportation) for their future customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charlotte is the most populous metropolitan area in North Carolina, and 15th most populous in the United States.  The population here is growing rapidly, with the US Census Bureau ranking it as the top area for millennial population growth from 2005 to 2015.  Millennials are always looking for that \"next trendy restaraunt\" in neighborhoods they may be unfamiliar with.  In addition, millennials are less likely to own personal transportation as compared to their predecessors. Together, these facts make targetting an area for a restaurant that is easy for millennials to travel to via public transportation important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The new location's area will be chosen by the results of a k-means cluster analysis of Charlotte's Zip Codes ([Link to Zip Codes online](https://www.zipcodestogo.com/North%20Carolina/).  These zip codes will be clustered on the basis of top venues in each area obtained from the Foursquare API.  Geographical locations of the neighborhood will be retrieved with the function geocoder from the geopy package in python.  The cluster analysis will be completed with the KMeans function from the sklearn package.\n",
